## Customization

### Branding
- Update the logo and brand name in `components/Header.tsx`
- Modify colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Update site metadata in `app/layout.tsx`

### Products
- The site automatically fetches products from both Printful and Printify
- Customize product display in `components/ProductCard.tsx`
- Add product categories and filtering
- Platform badges can be customized in the ProductCard component

### Styling
- Modify global styles in `app/globals.css`
- Update component styles using Tailwind classes
- Add custom animations in `tailwind.config.js`

## API Integration

The site is set up to work with both Printful and Printify APIs. Key integration points:

- **Unified Product Service**: `lib/products.ts` combines products from both platforms
- **Printful Integration**: `lib/printful.ts` contains the Printful API client
- **Printify Integration**: `lib/printify.ts` contains the Printify API client
- **Product Display**: `components/ProductCard.tsx` shows unified product information
- **Real Data**: Fetches real products from both platforms

To connect to real data:

1. Ensure your API keys are set in `.env.local` (development) or Vercel environment variables (production)
2. The unified product service will automatically fetch from both platforms
3. Your actual products will be displayed together on the site

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not loading**: Make sure CDN domains are configured in `next.config.js`
2. **API errors**: Check your API keys are correct for both platforms
3. **Build failures**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
4. **No products showing**: Verify products exist in your Printful/Printify stores

### Platform-Specific

1. **Printful**: Products must be synced to your store in the Printful dashboard
2. **Printify**: Products must be published to your shop in the Printify dashboard
3. **API Limits**: Both platforms have rate limits - the app handles this gracefully

### Vercel-Specific

1. **Environment variables**: Make sure all required env vars are set in Vercel dashboard
2. **Build timeouts**: The `vercel.json` config includes extended function timeouts
3. **Image optimization**: Next.js image optimization is enabled for both platforms
